## Overview

Agent-MemoryForge is a comprehensive 7-layer intelligent memory system designed for AI agents. This system integrates multi-modal memory fusion, allowing AI to process and recall information more effectively. The architecture supports context engineering, enhancing the AI's ability to adapt to different scenarios and user needs.

## Features

- **7-Layer Memory Structure**: Each layer specializes in a different aspect of memory, from short-term to long-term recall.
- **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Combines various data types (text, images, audio) for a richer memory experience.
- **Context Engineering**: Adapts memory usage based on the context of interactions.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to meet growing data needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple APIs for seamless integration into existing systems.

## Architecture

The architecture of Agent-MemoryForge consists of seven distinct layers, each serving a unique function:

1. **Sensory Input Layer**: Captures real-time data from various sources.
2. **Short-Term Memory Layer**: Stores temporary data for immediate recall.
3. **Long-Term Memory Layer**: Maintains information for extended periods.
4. **Multi-Modal Fusion Layer**: Integrates different data types into a cohesive memory.
5. **Contextual Analysis Layer**: Evaluates the context of data for improved relevance.
6. **Retrieval Layer**: Efficiently fetches information based on user queries.
7. **Feedback Loop Layer**: Continuously learns and adapts from user interactions.

## Installation

To get started with Agent-MemoryForge, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whisper-cpp/Agent-MemoryForge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Agent-MemoryForge
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/whisper-cpp/Agent-MemoryForge/releases) and execute the necessary files.

## Usage

To use Agent-MemoryForge, you can follow this simple example:

1. Import the library:
   ```python
   from agent_memory_forge import MemorySystem
   ```

2. Initialize the memory system:
   ```python
   memory = MemorySystem()
   ```

3. Add data to memory:
   ```python
   memory.add_data("example_key", "This is a sample memory entry.")
   ```

4. Retrieve data:
   ```python
   data = memory.retrieve_data("example_key")
   print(data)  # Output: This is a sample memory entry.
   ```

## Context Engineering

Context engineering is a key feature of Agent-MemoryForge. It allows the system to adjust its memory usage based on the current situation. For instance, when interacting with users, the AI can prioritize relevant memories based on past interactions, enhancing user experience.

### Example of Contextual Adaptation

```python
user_input = "Tell me about my last project."
contextual_memory = memory.contextualize(user_input)
print(contextual_memory)  # Output: Relevant memories based on the user's last project.
```
